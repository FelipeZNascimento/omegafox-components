## Commit Tags

I'm using `semantic-release` to perform releases and changelog. It's using `eslint` as a parser.
These are the release tags and what they do:

    tag: 'Breaking', release: 'major'
    tag: 'Fix', release: 'patch'
    tag: 'Update', release: 'minor'
    tag: 'New', release: 'minor'
